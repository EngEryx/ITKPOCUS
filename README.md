## About
The Traumatic Brain Injury Toolkit (tbitk) is an open source collection (Apache 2.0) of software libraries for automated processing and streaming of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) devices in order to support diagnosis of traumatic brain injury.  It currently has levels of support for Clarius, Butterfly, Sonivate, Sonoque, and Interson probes.

The Traumatic Brain Injury Toolkit is developed by Kitware, Inc. in collaboration with Duke University.  This effort was sponsored by the U.S. Government under Other Transactions Number W81XWH-15-9-0001/W81XWH-19-9-0015 (MTEC 19-08-MuLTI-0079).
